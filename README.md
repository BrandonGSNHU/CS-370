# CS-370

Briefly explain the work that you did on this project: What code were you given? What code did you create yourself?
  Throughout this project and course I was tasked with learning and applying AI trends into functional code. I was given code structures and examples to assist me as well as adding additional code to make the programs function properly and smoothly.

Connect your learning from throughout this course to the larger field of computer science:
What do computer scientists do and why does it matter?
  Computer scientists are vital in the development and inovation of software and hardware for computers. This is important because technology is always advancing and we can always further optimize our work. Even now the current trend is AI and it is everywhere in the industry as it advances.

How do I approach a problem as a computer scientist?
  I approach problems as a computer scientists with a very logical and structured approach. I have a problem and I need to most efficient and quickest solution to that problem. From there I can organize and plan out how I want to implement my solutions to the problem based off of the depth of the problem.

What are my ethical responsibilities to the end user and the organization?
  My ethical responsibilities to the end user and organization are massive. Being the one that develops and implements code and programs to keep user information and security safe I have direct access. With this kind of responsibility its up to me to properly secure that   information and prevent others from accessing it including myself. This makes my position very important because I'm the first line of defense for my client and organization.
